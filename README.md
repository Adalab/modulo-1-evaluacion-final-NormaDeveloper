First of all you have to make the layout on a given design: <br>
 . The hamburger button (in the upper left corner) should be fixed at the top of the screen and should not disappear when scrolling. The hamburger icon should be a link.  This hamburger menu does not display any submenus. <br>
 . First module (Anonymous proxy): it must be laid out with flexbox and must occupy the height of the browser window.<br>
 . Second module (Looking Through A Window): you can layout it using any CSS properties you want.<br>
 . Third module (3 Reasons To Purchase): the 3 elements of the listing must be laid out with CSS Grid in all screen sizes.<br>
 . Fourth module (footer): it must be laid out using flexbox.All texts in the "ARTICLES" column and all texts in the "TWITTER" column must be links.



## Interactions to resolve:

 . The hero module arrow button should link to the "3 Reasons To Purchase" section.<br>
 . The footer arrow button should link to the top of the page.<br>
 . All footer links should go to https://adalab.es.<br>
 .Button hover ("Go" and "3 Reasons To Purchase") should include a transition of your choice (e.g. color, size, etc.).
